(** (v2) Request specification.

    A Caqti request is a function to generate a query string from information
    about the driver, along with type descriptors to encode parameters and
    decode rows returned from the same query.  Requests are passed to
    {!Caqti_connection_sig.S.call} or one of its shortcut methods provided by a
    database connection handle.

    The request often represent a prepared query, in which case it is static and
    can be be defined directly in a module scope.  However, an optional
    [oneshot] parameter may be passed to indicate a dynamically generated
    query. *)

(** {2 Primitives} *)

type template =
  | L of string  (** Literal code. May contain incomplete fragments. *)
  | P of int     (** [P i] refers to parameter number [i], counting from 0. *)
  | S of template list (** [S frags] is the concatenation of [frags]. *)
(** A representation of a query string to send to a database, abstracting over
    parameter references and providing nested concatenation to simplify
    generation.  For databases which only support linear parameters (typically
    denoted "[?]"), the driver will reshuffle, elide, and duplicate parameters
    as needed.  *)

type ('a, 'b, +'m) t constraint 'm = [< `Zero | `One | `Many]
(** A request specification embedding a query generator, parameter encoder, and
    row decoder.
    - ['a] is the type of the expected parameter bundle.
    - ['b] is the type of a returned row.
    - ['m] is the possible multiplicities of returned rows. *)

val create :
  ?oneshot: bool ->
  'a Caqti_type.t -> 'b Caqti_type.t -> 'm Caqti_mult.t ->
  (Caqti_driver_info.t -> template) -> ('a, 'b, 'm) t
(** [create arg_type row_type row_mult f] is a request which takes parameters of
    type [arg_type], returns rows of type [row_type] with multiplicity
    [row_mult], and which sends query strings generated from the template [f
    di], where [di] is the {!Caqti_driver_info.t} of the target driver.  The
    driver is responsible for turning parameter references into a form accepted
    by the database, while other differences must be handled by [f]. *)

val param_type : ('a, _, _) t -> 'a Caqti_type.t
(** [param_type req] is the type of parameter bundles expected by [req]. *)

val row_type : (_, 'b, _) t -> 'b Caqti_type.t
(** [row_type req] is the type of rows returned by [req]. *)

val row_mult : (_, _, 'm) t -> 'm Caqti_mult.t
(** [row_mult req] indicates how many rows [req] may return.  This is asserted
    when constructing the query. *)

val query_id : ('a, 'b, 'm) t -> int option
(** If [req] is a prepared query, then [query_id req] is [Some id] for some [id]
    which uniquely identifies [req], otherwise it is [None]. *)

val query_template : ('a, 'b, 'm) t -> Caqti_driver_info.t -> template
(** [query_template req] is the function which generates the query template for
    a driver for this request. *)

(** {2 Convenience}

    In the following functions, queries are specified as plain strings using
    linear parameters in the style of Sqlite3 and MySQL.  That is, occurrences
    of "[?]" are bound to successive parameters independent of the parameter
    style used by the database.  For PostgreSQL "[$1]", "[$2]", ... are
    substituted for "[?]".

    Apart from the more generic {!create_p}, these function match up with
    retrieval functions of {!Caqti_connection_sig.S} and {!Caqti_response_sig.S}
    according to the multiplicity parameter of their types. *)

val create_p :
  ?oneshot: bool ->
  'a Caqti_type.t -> 'b Caqti_type.t -> 'm Caqti_mult.t ->
  (Caqti_driver_info.t -> string) -> ('a, 'b, 'm) t
(** [create_p arg_type row_type row_mult f] is a request which takes parameters
    of type [arg_type], returns rows of type [row_type] with multiplicity
    [row_mult], and which sends a query string based on a preliminary form given
    by [f di], where [di] is the {!Caqti_driver_info.t} of the target driver.
    The preliminary query string may contain occurrences of "[?]", which are
    replaced by successive parameter references.  This is implemented as [create
    arg_type row_type (parse % f)] where [parse] parses a string into a
    template.

    @param oneshot
      For queries generated on-demand or which are otherwise executed only once,
      pass [true] do make the query non-prepared.  By default queries are
      prepared, which is suitable for requests defined at the module level. *)

val exec :
  ?oneshot: bool -> 'a Caqti_type.t ->
  string -> ('a, unit, [> `Zero]) t
(** [exec_p arg_type s] is a shortcut for [create_p arg_type Caqti_type.unit
    Caqti_mult.zero (fun _ -> s)]. *)

val find :
  ?oneshot: bool -> 'a Caqti_type.t -> 'b Caqti_type.t ->
  string -> ('a, 'b, [> `One]) t
(** [find_p arg_type row_type s] is a shortcut for [create_p arg_type row_type
    Caqti_mult.one (fun _ -> s)]. *)

val find_opt :
  ?oneshot: bool -> 'a Caqti_type.t -> 'b Caqti_type.t ->
  string -> ('a, 'b, [> `Zero | `One]) t
(** [find_opt_p arg_type row_type s] is a shortcut for [create_p arg_type
    row_type Caqti_mult.zero_or_one (fun _ -> s)]. *)

val collect :
  ?oneshot: bool -> 'a Caqti_type.t -> 'b Caqti_type.t ->
  string -> ('a, 'b, [> `Zero | `One | `Many]) t
(** [collect_p arg_type row_type s] is a shortcut for [create_p arg_type
    row_type Caqti_mult.many (fun _ -> s)]. *)
