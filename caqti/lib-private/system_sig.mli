(** Signature for concurrency model and OS-calls.

    This is the common part of the signature declarning system dependencies.
    Driver will usually require an extended signature, as provided by

      - {!Caqti_platform_unix.System_sig.S} for drivers which depend on the unix
        library
      - {!Caqti_platform_net.System_sig.S} for drivers which can manage with a
        network stack implemented in pure OCaml
  *)

module type S = sig

  type +'a future
  (** A concurrency monad with an optional failure monad, or just the identity
      type constructor for blocking operation. *)

  val (>>=) : 'a future -> ('a -> 'b future) -> 'b future
  (** Bind operation of the concurrency monad. *)

  val (>|=) : 'a future -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b future
  (** Map operation of the concurrency monad. *)

  val return : 'a -> 'a future
  (** Return operation of the  concurrency monad. *)

  val catch : (unit -> 'a future) -> (exn -> 'a future) -> 'a future

  val finally : (unit -> 'a future) -> (unit -> unit future) -> 'a future
  (** [finally f g] runs [f ()] and then runs [g ()] whether the former
      finished, failed with an exception, or failed with a monadic failure. *)

  val cleanup : (unit -> 'a future) -> (unit -> unit future) -> 'a future
  (** [cleanup f g] runs [f ()] and then runs [g ()] and re-raise the failure if
      and only if [f ()] failed with an exception or a monadic failure. *)
