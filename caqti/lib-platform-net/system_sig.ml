        entries which is expected to work with the corresponding connect on the
        platform implementing this interface.  In particular:

          - The family can be IPv4 or IPv6, where supported, and this must be
            encoded in the {!Sockaddr.t}.
          - The socket type is restricted to STREAM.
          - The protocol is assumed to be selected automatically from address
            family, given the socket type restriction.

        All returned values are TCP destinations.  If a distinction can be made,
        an empty list indicates that the address has no DNS entries, while an
        error return indicates that an appropriate DNS server could not be
