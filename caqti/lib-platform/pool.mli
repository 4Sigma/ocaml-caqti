  (** {b Internal:} [create alloc free] is a pool of resources allocated by
      [alloc] and freed by [free]. This is primarily intended for implementing
      the [connect_pool] functions.

      @param max_size
        The maximum number of allocated resources.

      @param max_idle_size
        The maximum number of resources to pool for later use. Defaults to
        [max_size].

      @param max_use_count
        The maximum number of times to use a connection, or [None] for no limit.

      @param check
        A function used to check a resource after use.

      @param validate
        A function to check before use that a resource is still valid. *)
