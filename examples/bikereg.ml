(* This is an example of how to use Caqti directly in application code.
 * This way of defining typed wrappers around queries should also work for
 * code-generators. *)

let (>>=) = Lwt.(>>=)

(* Query Strings
 * =============
 *
 * Queries are normally registered in advance.  This allows Caqti to emit
 * prepared queries which are reused throughout the lifetime of the
 * connection.  The two most useful functions to do this are
 *
 *   - [prepare_sql] creates a query string which should work with all SQL
 *     databases of interest.
 *
 *   - [prepare_fun] creates a per-database query string.
 *
 * It's possible to avoid many dialect variation cases by using a function
 * which translates the placeholders for parameters, like [Q._q] defined in
 * [tests/test_sql_lwt.ml]. *)

module Q = struct
  let create_bikereg =
    prepare_sql "CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE bikereg \
		 (frameno TEXT NOT NULL, owner TEXT NOT NULL,
		  stolen TIMESTAMP)"
    (* Since this is only used once, we could have used a oneshot-query. *)

  let reg_bike = prepare_fun @@ function
    | `Pgsql -> "INSERT INTO bikereg (frameno, owner) VALUES ($1, $2)"
    | `Sqlite -> "INSERT INTO bikereg (frameno, owner) VALUES (?, ?)"
    | _ -> raise Missing_query_string

  let report_stolen = prepare_fun @@ function
    | `Pgsql ->
      "UPDATE bikereg SET stolen = current_timestamp WHERE frameno = $1"
    | `Sqlite ->
      "UPDATE bikereg SET stolen = current_timestamp WHERE frameno = ?"
    | _ -> raise Missing_query_string

  let select_stolen =
    prepare_sql "SELECT frameno, owner, stolen \
		 FROM bikereg WHERE stolen IS NOT NULL"

  let select_frameno = prepare_fun @@ function
    | `Pgsql -> "SELECT * FROM bikereg WHERE frameno = $1"
    | `Sqlite -> "SELECT * FROM bikereg WHERE frameno = ?"
    | _ -> raise Missing_query_string
end

(* Wrappers around the Generic Execution Functions
 * ===============================================
 *
 * Here we combine the above queries with a suitable execution function, for
 * convenience and to enforce type safety.  We could have defined these in a
 * functor on CONNECTION and used the resulting module in place of Db. *)

(* Db.exec runs a statement which must not return any rows.  Errors are
 * reported as exceptions. *)
let create_bikereg (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) =
  Db.exec Q.create_bikereg [||]
let reg_bike (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) frameno owner =
  Db.exec Q.reg_bike Db.Param.([|text frameno; text owner|])
let report_stolen (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) frameno =
  Db.exec Q.report_stolen Db.Param.([|text frameno|])

(* Db.find runs a query which must return at most one row.  The result is a
 * option, since it's common to seach for entries which don't exist. *)
let find_bike_owner frameno (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) =
  Db.find Q.select_frameno Db.Tuple.(text 1) Db.Param.([|text frameno|])

(* As a helper for iterators, [wrap db f] accepts a raw tuple and passes its
 * converted components as arguments to [f].  First-class modules are
 * brilliant, though they sometimes requires us to elaborate type
 * dependencies.  *)
let wrap (type tuple) (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION with type tuple = tuple)
	 f (t : tuple) =
  let open Db.Tuple in
  (* You might prefer to pass the result as a tuple or record depending on the
   * application. *)
  f ~frameno:(text 0 t) ~owner:(text 1 t) ?stolen:(option utc 2 t) ()

(* Db.iter_s iterates sequentially over the set of result rows of a query. *)
let iter_s_stolen (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) f =
  Db.iter_s Q.select_stolen (wrap (module Db) f) [||]

(* There is also a Db.iter_p for parallel processing, and Db.fold and
 * Db.fold_s for accumulating information from the result rows. *)
